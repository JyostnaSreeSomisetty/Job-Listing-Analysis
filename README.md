**Job Listings Analytics Dashboard**

This project analyzes job listings data scraped from platforms like Indeed and Glassdoor to identify hiring trends, in-demand skills, salary ranges, and regional job distributions. The raw data was cleaned and stored in a relational database using SQL. We performed exploratory data analysis and business-focused queries to extract actionable insights. Results were visualized using Tableau dashboards for interactive exploration. This project demonstrates end-to-end skills in web scraping, data wrangling, SQL, and BI visualization.
